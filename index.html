        <p>Hello, my name is Christian Martinez, and I am a student at Brigham Young University–Idaho, pursuing a degree in Software Development. I have a passion for technology and am particularly interested in building solutions that are both functional and efficient. When I'm not studying or working on projects, I love listening to music—it helps me relax and feel inspired. I also enjoy playing video games, which I find both fun and a way to explore different storytelling and design perspectives. I cherish spending quality time with my girlfriend and family, as they are an essential part of my life. A memorable experience for me was serving a mission in San Pedro Sula, my hometown in Honduras, where I dedicated time to helping others and gaining invaluable life experiences. Professionally, I work as a data analyst, where I analyze data to help drive decision-making processes, combining both technical skills and a keen eye for details to deliver meaningful insights.</p>
